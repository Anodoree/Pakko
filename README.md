    The work was created based on materials from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxQpayexHnI&t=6s">the video on YouTube</a>. within the framework of the competition, it was necessary to complete part of the layout and, most importantly, to adapt to different screen widths. After stopping the contest, three finalists were chosen. Within five days the voting took place and my work won with a noticeable advantage! Now it is listed in the description <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oxQpayexHnI&t=6s">below the video</a>.
